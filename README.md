# openweather-pandas
Just a practice project i made based on the openweather api that returns levels of air pollution on given coordinates and timestamp, just run the code below to set database, api and query settings:
```
python main.py config
```
then run the next one to get the request on a dataframe and on a table created on specified database:
```
python main.py request
```
And now added a create plot function which, for some reason, is lagging a lot with my 700 rows example, ill search more on that later:
